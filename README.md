This project was created to translate from Mathematica (wolfram) to Python an assignment I did in one of the first semester courses of my master's degree in data science at the University of Aberdeen.

The aim of this code is to provide insights into fatal and non-fatal airplane accidentology events by examining the most common causes of accidents and occurrences for worldwide domestic scheduled passenger flights since 1919 of dataset analysis: ****Aircraft Accidents, Failures & Hijacks Dataset**** it is a complete dataset of Aircraft Accidents, Failures & Hijacks since 1919.
